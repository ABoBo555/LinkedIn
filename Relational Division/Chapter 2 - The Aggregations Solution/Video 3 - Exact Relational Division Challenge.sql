/*
Modify the query that matches candidates for the DB Architect role so that dividends with remainders are eliminated.
To put it nicely, I don’t want to see Darrin, or any other ‘overqualified’ candidate who has more skills than what the role requires.

Hints:
> An exact relational division is just a standard relational division, with an additional constraint on top.
> There was a good reason that I used a JOIN instead an IN predicate.

Expected Result:

┌───────────┐
│Candidate	│
├───────────┤
│Chen 		│
└───────────┘

Good luck!
