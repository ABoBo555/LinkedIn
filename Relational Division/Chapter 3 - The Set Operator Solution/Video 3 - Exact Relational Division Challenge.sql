/*
Your challenge for this chapter is to modify this query so that candidates with a remainder will be eliminated. 
To put it nicely, I don’t want to see Darrin, or any other candidate who has more than the required skills.

Enjoy and good luck!

> An exact relational division is just a standard relational division, with an additional constraint on top.
> You are not allowed to use aggregates this time. Only set operators this time.

Expected Result:

┌───────────┐
│Candidate	│
├───────────┤
│Chen 		│
└───────────┘
